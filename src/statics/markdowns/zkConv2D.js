const zkConv2D = `#  zkConv2D

The zkConv2D function is designed to generate zero-knowledge proofs for the output of a 2D convolution operation, allowing the verification of the correctness of the operation without revealing the input data or the filters used.    
   
## Code
 - **Python Code:**
   
   - Takes as input the filters, bias, and input array, along with an optional directory path. 
   - It performs the convolution operation using the conv2d function, writes the necessary data to JSON files for Zokrates
   - Uses Zokrates to compile, setup, compute the witness, generate the proof, and verify the proof. 
   - Returns the output of the convolution operation and the generated proof.

 - **Zokrates Code:**
    - It imports the constants num_filters, filter_size, input_size, and channels from a size.zok file. 
    - The conv2d function defined here performs the convolution operation, matching the operation performed in the Python code. 
    - The main function takes private filters and bias, a public input array, and a public computed output array as input. 
    - It asserts that the computed output matches the expected output from the convolution operation, thereby generating a zero-knowledge proof of the correctness of the operation.
	    
## Limitations:

 - The process of generating zero-knowledge proofs can be computationally intensive, especially for large input arrays or complex filters. 
 - This function is designed for a fixed array size, which may not be ideal for very large or dynamic arrays. 

## Example Model: 
Convolutional Neural Networks [CNNs](/examples/CNN), It can be used to prove the correctness of a convolution operation without revealing the input data or the model's internal computations. This allows for the verification of model predictions or outputs while maintaining data privacy, which is crucial in scenarios where data confidentiality is a priority.`
