const zkRelu = `#  zkRelu

The zkRelu function is designed to generate zero-knowledge proofs for the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) operation, which is a common activation function in neural networks. The ReLU function outputs the input directly if it is positive; otherwise, it outputs zero.    
## Code
 - **Python Code:**
   
   - Takes as input an array of values (arguments) and an optional directory path. 
   - It processes the input array to ensure all values are positive, which is a requirement for the ReLU operation. 
   - It then writes the necessary data to JSON files for Zokrates, and uses Zokrates to compile, setup, compute the witness, generate the proof, and verify the proof. 
   - Returns the generated proof and the modified array (with all values positive).

 - **Zokrates Code:**
 
    - It imports the constant size from a size.zok file. 
    - The zkRelu function defined here performs the ReLU operation on an array of values. 
    - It iterates through each value in the array, ensuring that each value is greater than or equal to a threshold (which is a parameter of the function). 
    - The main function takes a private array of values and a threshold as input. It asserts that the zkRelu function returns true, thereby generating a zero-knowledge proof of the correctness of the ReLU operation.
## Limitations:

 - The process of generating zero-knowledge proofs can be computationally intensive, especially for large input arrays or complex filters. 
 - This function only works on 1D Array.

## Example Model: 
 - The ReLU is the most used activation function.Since, it is used in almost all the convolutional neural networks[CNN](/examples/CNN) or deep learning.
