const zkMaxLabelMd = `#  zkMaxLabel

This function finds the most frequent label in a given set of labels. It uses the Zokrates library to validate the computation in zero-knowledge.
    
   
## Code
 - **Python Code:**

	 -  The function zkMaxLabel takes three arguments: the output of a labeling algorithm, the number of labels K, and a dir_path.
    
	- It first extracts the labels from the output and counts the frequency of each label.
    
	- It then finds the label with the maximum frequency and adds it to the labels.
    
	- The function then writes the size of the labels to a size.zok file, which is used by Zokrates.
    
	- The function then runs several Zokrates commands to compile the code, set up the proving scheme, compute the witness, and generate the proof.
    
	- The function returns the proof and the most frequent label.
    

  

 - **Zokrates Code:**
    
	-   The Zokrates code is written in the maxLabel.zok file.
	
	-  It imports the size of the labels from the size.zok file and defines several functions, gt, changefunc, newitr, and main.
    
    - The gt function checks if one number is greater than another.
    
	-  The changefunc function creates a new label with a count of 1.
    
	- The newitr function increments an iterator.
    
	-  The main function finds the most frequent label in the input and returns it.
	    
## Limitations:
 -   The function assumes that the output of the labeling algorithm is valid and that the dir_path is valid. 
 - It also assumes that the Zokrates commands are correctly installed and available in the system path.

## Example Model: 
The function can be used with the output of any labeling algorithm. Also, in various applications where label frequency analysis is required or any classification model, such as [KNN](/examples), where the most frequent label is used to classify the test point.
