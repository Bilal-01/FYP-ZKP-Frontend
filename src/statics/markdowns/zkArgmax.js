const zkArgmaxMD = `#  zkArgmax

This function generates zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for efficiently proving the index of the maximum value in an array, while keeping the array elements themselves confidential.
    
   
## Code
 - **Python Code:**

    - Takes an array of output probabilities and a directory path as input.
    - Writes the probabilities to argmax.json.
    - Calls getArguments and setSize.
    - Uses Zokrates to compile, setup, compute witness, generate proof, and verify the proof for the zk-SNARK.
    - Returns the proof and the predicted index (index of the maximum value).

 - **Zokrates Code:**
    - Defines constants like N (array size), MAX_POS_VAL (maximum positive value), and nsize (size minus 1).
    - Compares two values and returns true if the first is greater than the second.
    - Argmax Takes an array of values as input and returns the index of the maximum value using a loop and comparison.
    - In main it takes a private array and a public index as input, computes the argmax using argmax, asserts that the computed index matches the public index, and returns the index.
	    
## Limitations:

 - Proof generation can be slow, especially for large arrays.
 - Fixed array size, not ideal for very large or dynamic arrays.


## Example Model: 
The function can be used in [CNN](/examples/CNN) and [decision trees](/examples/DecisionTree). In these cases, the zk-SNARK could be used to prove that the model has made a specific prediction on an input without revealing the model's weights or internal computations.
