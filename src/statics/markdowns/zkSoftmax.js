The softmax function ensures that the output values are in the range (0, 1) and sum up to 1, making them suitable for classification problems where the output represents the probability of each class.

## Code
 - **Python Code:**
  

 - **Zokrates Code:**
  - The code starts by importing a constant size from a size.zok file. This size likely represents the number of elements in the array that the softmax operation will be applied to.
  - The summation function iterates over an array of unsigned 64-bit integers (u64[N] arr) and returns their sum. This function is crucial for calculating the sum of the softmax outputs, which should equal 1 for a correctly normalized softmax output.
  - The nonNeg function checks if all elements in an array (u64[N] res) are non-negative and greater than or equal to a given threshold (u64 a). This function ensures that the softmax operation has been applied correctly, as the softmax function should output non-negative values.
  - The main function is the entry point of the Zokrates program. It takes three parameters:
            - private u64[size] val: An array of values (likely the outputs of the softmax operation).
            - u64 threshold: A threshold value used to ensure all values are non-negative.
            - u64 hp: A precomputed value representing the sum of all elements in the array, which should be equal to 1 for a correctly normalized softmax output.
  - The main function asserts two conditions:
        - All elements in the val array are non-negative and greater than or equal to the threshold using the nonNeg function.
        - The sum of all elements in the val array equals the hp value using the summation function.
## Limitations:

## Example Model: 
 - The Softmax is the widely used activation function.Since, it is used in almost all the convolutional neural networks[CNN](/examples/CNN) or deep learning.
