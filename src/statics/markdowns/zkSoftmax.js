const ZkSoftmax = `#  ZkSoftmax

The softmax function ensures that the output values are in the range (0, 1) and sum up to 1, making them suitable for classification problems where the output represents the probability of each class.

## Code
 - **Python Code:**
      - The zkSoftmax function takes an array of arguments (presumably the output of a softmax function), and a directory path (dir_path).
      - It applies softmax function to the input array to convert raw scores into probabilities.
      - It normalizes the probabilities and prepares the data for Zokrates.
      - It sets up the necessary files and directories for Zokrates, including size.zok and input.json.
      - It runs Zokrates commands to compile the code, set up proving scheme, compute witness, and generate proof.
      - Finally, it returns the generated proof and the original softmax output array.

  

 - **Zokrates Code:**
  - The Zokrates code is written in softmax.zok.
  - It imports size.zok, which defines the size of the input array.
  - The summation function calculates the sum of the array elements after applying a threshold.
  - The nonNeg function checks if all elements in the array are non-negative.
  - The main function validates that the sum of the array elements after applying the threshold equals a predefined value (hp), and all elements are non-negative. It uses assertions for validation.
## Limitations:
- The function assumes that Zokrates is correctly installed and available in the system path.
- It also assumes that the input arguments are correctly formatted and that the softmax function output is valid.
- Additionally, the code seems to be designed for specific use cases and may require modification for different scenarios or input formats.
## Example Model: 
 - The Softmax is the widely used activation function.Since, it is used in almost all the convolutional neural networks[CNN](/examples/CNN) or deep learning.
