const zkTreeTraversal = `#  zkTreeTraversal

This function demonstrates a technique for generating zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) that verify the correct traversal of a decision tree without revealing the tree's structure or the input data. This approach offers privacy-preserving computation for decision tree models in various applications.
    
   
## Code
 - **Python Code:**
 - *zkTreeTraversal* prepares the input data, normalizes it, and writes it to a file along with other required information.
 - Zokrates commands are executed to compile the code, set up the proving scheme, compute the witness, and generate the proof.
 - The proof is then loaded from the generated proof.json file and returned.
 
 - **Zokrates Code:**
 - The Zokrates code defines a *'Node'* struct to represent a decision tree node.
 - The *'traverse'* function performs tree traversal based on the input data (X) and returns the predicted probabilities.
 - The *'main'* function checks if the predicted probabilities match the expected final probabilities.
## Limitations:
 - The function assumes valid input data and Zokrates installation in the system.
 - It's designed for decision tree traversal and may not cover all use cases.
 Security considerations must be taken into account when integrating with other components.

## Example Model: 
The zkTreeTraversal function can be utilized as part of a privacy-preserving machine learning model, allowing secure predictions without revealing sensitive information. It can be integrated into various applications, such as secure data classification or [decision-making](/examples/DecisionTree) processes.`
